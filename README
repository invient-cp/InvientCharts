PREREQUISITES
Invient Charts is a Vaadin wrapper for Highcharts, a JavaScript library. 
Rendering of the charts on the browser is performed by Highcharts.
Invient Charts exposes Highcharts' features to Vaadin programmers via 
a server-side API.

Note:
* Compile the widgetset after adding Inveint Charts jar file into the 
project's classpath.
* Load Highcharts JavaScript libarary files by extending Vaadin's 
ApplicationServlet. Check the source code under demo directory for details.
* Highcharts uses jQuery. Load jQuery library (v 1.4.4 or above) before 
loading Highcharts JavaScript files.

If you are using eclipse based project structure, then you can store the 
JavaScript files in webapp directory.

LICENSE
Invient Charts is licensed under Apache License 2.0. However, it requires 
Highcharts JavaScript library which is licensed under separate terms:
http://www.highcharts.com/license. You must, therefore, adhere to both
licenses to use Invient Charts in your application.

DEMO DATA

Highcharts Demo Gallery at http://www.highcharts.com/demo/.
