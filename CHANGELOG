Invient Charts 0.8.6 (released 2011-12-02)
Fixed the following bugs:
 * Set min/max values for chart's axis.
 * Show/hide of a series after creation of the chart.
 * removePoint() method to remove all points instead of only one point.

Invient Charts 0.8.5 (released 2011-08-24)
Fixed following bugs
 * Set height of the chart.
 * Disable tooltip.
 * Hide series.
  
Invient Charts 0.8.4 (released 2011-06-30)
  * Fixed bug related to color attribute. The SeriesConfig.color attribute is written to client for all subclasses of SeriesConfig.
  * The min and max attributes of DateTimeAxis include time if the DateTimeSeries associated with this axis has isIncludeTime set to true.
  * Added new API to iterate over all Series of a graph.
  * The interfaces com.invient.vaadin.charts.Color and com.invient.vaadin.charts.Gradient have been modified to extend newly added interface com.invient.vaadin.charts.Paint. This is done to facilitate use of gradient in all types of charts.

Invient Charts 0.8.3 (released 2011-04-21)
  * Improvement in performance when the series has more than couple of thousands of points, say 30,000 points.
  * The Point.setX() and Point.setY() methods have been removed. The x and y value of a point must be set when a point is created, if required.
  * The DateTimeSeries.setIsIncludeTime(boolean) method has been removed. The same can be achieved by using appropriate constructor having isIncludeTime as one of its argument.

Invient Charts 0.8.2 (released 2011-03-23)
  * Enhancement: Printing.
  * Enhancement: Asynchronous method to get SVG.
  * Enhancement: Add or remove points on an existing series.
  * Demo: Added "Click to add a point", and "Updating each second".
  * Note: "Updating each second" will not work on GAE because GAE 
    doesn't support threads.

Invient Charts 0.8.1 (released 2011-03-15)
  * Fixed: "undefined NumberFormatException" when using Internet Explorer.

Invient Charts 0.8.0 (released 2011-03-10)
  * Initial Release
